**Objective**
The objective of this code is to respond to the functionality presented in the Podvisory backend challenge. It has two endpoints detailed in the api.html file and in testing section from this file.

---

**Technologies**
This challenge is solved principally with NodeJs, Express and Mongoose. Besides that, it uses Jest and mongodb-memory-server for testing. It also has different config files for globally set the prettier/eslint configuration for all the project and the node version needed to run this server.

**Assumptions and Design Decisions**
The incoming data from the csv file is storing in a real database, not in a file and not in-memory database. I made this decision because its has the potencial to be used in a real envoirement. The reading of the file does not need file storing, it just use the buffer to parse the csv data into a json.

**Documentation**
The file api.html has the entire documentation for this API. There you could find a description of each endpoint, with his parameters, responses, and examples.

---

**Testing**
There is a db manager (dbManager.js) that allows creating a virtual database to be able to carry out all the tests without having to modify the real database
You can use the / endpoint (default: http://localhost:3000/) for a html file with two inputs: The file to upload and the user name, and a button to make a post to /vehicles.

**Instalation**

- Before you clone this project make sure you have installed the following requirements in your environment:
  - [**NodeJS & NPM**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
  - [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (MongoClient needs to be up and running)
- Run command `npm i` on the same route as package.json file.
- If you are ussing nvm (node version manager), run `nvm use`. You need at least version 12.18.3 to run this server.

---

**Execution**

- To start running the server use the command: `npm start`. From this point the API is ready to be used.
- To start testing on the server use command: `npm test`.
- If you want to create and save on you database mockdata use the comand `npm mockdata`.

```
There are some environment variables you can change:
* **NODE_ENV:** sets the environment you are working on (default: development).
* **API_HOSTNAME:** sets the API's hostname (default: 127.0.0.1)
* **API_PORT:** sets the API's port (default: 3000).
* **DB_HOSTNAME:** sets the database hostname (default: 127.0.0.1).
* **DB_PORT:** sets the database port (default: 27017).

Find more information about the API's endpoint in the api.html file.
